Simple Chat Server
==================
This is the implementation of our chat server used for the iOS Development course at FH Hagenberg.
To run the server on your local host (on port 8080), clone the project, install go and then type
```
go run chat.go
```
To run the server on heroku, install the heroku toolbelt and create the application like this:
```
heroku create -b https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
```
